Keybase Unseal
==============

This Ansible role for initializing and unsealing Hashicorp Vault creates one
encrypted JSON file for your team Keybase team in KBFS. Default is a macOS path.

You can create a Keybase account and a team with sub-team on:
[https://keybase.io](https://keybase.io)

Requirements
------------

Create users on [https://keybase.io](https://keybase.io) and define
`keybase_team:` in group_vars. Let the users install the Keybase.app on
multiple personal devices. Let them add proof for their online identities, so
they have [Skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book)).

Python libraries for the ansible control host are listed in requirements.txt.
The best experience is on a Mac due to the integration of Keybase, GPG Suite,
Apple Keychain, Ansible, etc. This was made on a Mac.

All trusted users should publish their public PGP key on Keybase if you want
[Shamir Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

Fun fact: **Shamir** is the S in RSA, he is a well-known cryptographer.

Secret-Zero & Shamir
====================
Shamir Secret Sharing is an algorithm in cryptography, backed by mathematics
 where no single person should be able to hold enough keys to
the Vault kingdom. A group of trustees is each given an individual unseal key by the
dealer. A preset treshold of key holders is needed to unseal the Vault.

The essential idea of Adi Shamir's threshold scheme is that 2 points are sufficient
to define a line, 3 points are sufficient to define a parabola, 4 points to define
a cubic curve and so forth.

This ansible role automates the dealer.

Sharing Secret-Zero
===================

Keybase KBFS creates an encrypted shared filesystem for your team. This is used
to store 2 critical files: `vault.json` and `vault.pass`. The JSON file is the
same as the output of `vault operator init ...`: having PGP encrypted unseal keys,
each one encrypted with the public key of one of the team members. Each team
member is only authorized to their part, they should team up to unseal Vault. i
This four-eyes, six-eyes, or n-eyes principle governs the capability to unseal
Hashicorp Vault. And that is a valuable principle.

Therefore it is a small feat to encrypt this `vault.json` file with ansible-vault, and
another small feat to have this shared only with the trustees in a Keybase subteam.
The real value lies in the lockdown of individual unseal keys over a team that can work
remotely, and in different shifts or timezones, because the ideal automation does
not store the unseal keys unencrypted principle. Moreover the ideal automation should
preserve Shamir Secret Sharing at rest.

At the moment there are 2 ways to deal with the unseal keys, the `shamir` boolean variable
is used to drive the playbook. When it is true it takes a couple of people to unseal the
vault. When it is false the playbook can simply iterate over the unencrypted unseal keys
to unseal the vault and do further automation.

TODO: I'd like to change the implementation a bit as to initialize with known unseal keys,
that are encrypted to each `keybase_team` member's PGP key after an unseal, because that
will allow full provisioning at cluster creation time.

Role variables
==============

```
vault_credentials: '/keybase/team/{{ keybase_team }}/vault.json'
```

The `vault.pass` file is stored here for remote work.

```
export KEYBASE_TEAM=dockpack.vault
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE="/keybase/team/$KEYBASE_TEAM/vault.pass"
```

You can store the `vault.pass` file on KBFS, it encrypts a temporary root token,
but each unseal key is encrypted with one member's PGP key,
(as long as **shamir: true** that is). Replacing the initial root token after
set-up is a best practice.

For decryption of `vault.json` with `ansible-vault` this environment
variable should be defined: `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`. Your team can agree
on a secret-zero out-of-band.

To work with the initial root token in your ENV:
```
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(ansible-vault view "/keybase/team/$KEYBASE_TEAM/vault.json"| jq -r .root_token)
```

Role Variables
--------------

`keybase_team:` the name of the Keybase team responsible for Vault operations.

If `shamir: true`, then Shamir Secret Sharing is enforced because Hashicorp
Vault will be initialized with encrypted unseal keys in the output. Each
trusted user can only decrypt their own key.

If `shamir: false`, then the Keybase team is the basis of shared trust, great
for automation, but less secure.

`key_threshold:` number of keys are needed to unseal the Vault, with
`shamir: true` this means that `key_threshold` number of members of the
`keybase_team` should run the playbook with `--tags unseal`.

`kbt:` is a set of trusted users in the Keybase team, avoid duplicates.
`export KBT_INDEX=<n>` to your index in this list.

`key_shares:` is the number of generated unseal keys, by default the length of `kbt:`.

Dependencies
------------
I use this role in a larger project, where I depend on these fine roles to
install Consul and Vault, among others.

```yaml
---
  - src: brianshumate.vault
  - src: brianshumate.consul
  - src: leonallen22.ansible_role_keybase
```

Example Playbook
----------------

A full example of a Vault Cluster with a Consul backend and a client and a
bastion is available:
